For the server, I mainly use thinkphp5 to build it.<br>
php is used to handle the post and get request from html.<br>
I also use mysql to store the data from html, and users can also use web page to edit the data. <br>

Besides, it also provides a page to upload file and save it on the server.<br>
If this file is an image, you can choose to add watermark for it.<br>
