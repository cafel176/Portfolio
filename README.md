# Portfolio
A personal Portfolio project. <br>
This is the data management system, focusing on storing and editing data.<br>

I mainly use jquery and bootstrap to build the HTML web page.<br>
Use HTML, CSS, javascript in these pages.<br>

<br>
For the server, I mainly use thinkphp5 to build it.<br>
PHP is used to handle the post and get a request from HTML.<br>
I also use MySQL to store the data from HTML, and users can also use a web page to edit the data. <br>

Besides, it also provides a page to upload a file and save it on the server.<br>
If this file is an image, you can choose to add watermark for it.<br>
